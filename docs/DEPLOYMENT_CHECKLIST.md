npm start
```

## üö® **Common Production Issues & Solutions**

### **CORS Errors**
- Update `CORS_ORIGIN` in backend to include production frontend URL
- Ensure credentials are properly configured

### **Environment Variables Not Found**
- Verify `.env` files exist and are properly formatted
- Check if hosting platform loads environment variables correctly

### **Image Upload Fails**
- Verify Cloudinary URL is correctly configured
- Check network connectivity and API limits

### **Payment Processing Fails**
- Ensure Stripe is in live mode
- Verify webhook endpoints are configured
- Check API keys and secrets

## üìä **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### **Performance Monitoring**

## üìû **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Quick Debugging Commands**
```bash
# Check environment variables
node -e "console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL)"

# Test API connectivity
curl https://your-production-api.com/api/health

# Check build output
ls -la build/  # frontend
ls -la dist/   # backend (if using TypeScript)
```

### **Log Locations**
- Frontend: Browser console and network tab
- Backend: Server logs and error tracking service
- Database: MongoDB logs
- CDN: Cloudinary dashboard
